Jan 1, 2025 (chest/back)
Chest press machine
* 90a x 10 x 3
* Notes: Fine. Feel a little bit momentarily.
Machine fly 
* 60a x 10 x 3
* Notes: fine
Serratus anterior wall planks
* bw x 10 x 5 sec hold x 2
Notes: overall, very much fine.
________________
Jan 3, 2025 (legs)
Squat
* 55 x 8 x 4
* Notes: slight head tightness after the first set. But then completely fine after the fourth set. Maybe can try going up next time cautiously, to see what happens. Suggest 5 increase.
Leg curl machine 
* 85a x 10 x 3
* Notes: fine
Adduction machine
* 130 (/2) x 10 x 3
* Notes: fine. Getting a bit light. Let’s increase this further, since adduction is naturally stronger. Around 1.5x
Abduction machine
* 130 (/2) x 10 x 3
* Notes: fine. Getting a bit light as well can  increase both 
Notes: overall, very much fine.
________________
Jan 4, 2025 (arms/abs)
Cable rear delt fly
* 10e x 10 x 4
* Notes: pretty intense sets. Feels fine. Can feel a little bit of head tightness, but at this point, not sure if it’s just normal or placebo. 
DB side delt raises
* 15e x 10 x 3
* Notes: slight migraine coming back on left side of temple. Then switches over to a slight head tightness. Perhaps not ready for this intensity? Okay. Might be pointing towards neck tension rather than brain injury. Because the migraine is tension feeling.
SH Cable Tricep extension
* 12.5e x 10 x LR x 3
* Notes: a bit on the light side now can increase
45 Incline bicep curls
* 20e x 10 x 3
* Notes: very fatiguing but head is ok. Makes me think even more that the migraine and slight tension in the head is a result of tight shoulders and neck, not head injury.
Cable Woodchopper
* 20a x 10 x LR x 2
* Notes: fine. Still can stay this weight is good. Overall, I think the realization is that my head is fine, it most likely neck and shoulder tension and can be relieved through neck stretches and is aggregated by further neck involvement.

Cable external rotation
* 2.5e x 10 x LR x 2
* Notes: Fine.
Reverse crunches 
* Bw x 12 x 1
* Notes: hmm abs are sore from a wheel roller session. At a reduced intensity out of fatigue?
Knee touch crunches (upper abs)
* bw x 20 x 2
Side planks
* Bw x 45 sec x LR x 2
* Notes: slight tightness immediately after exercise. Alleviated by neck/shoulder stretch. Makes me think that head is probably fine again.

Abduction machine
* 160 (/2) x 10 x 3
* Notes: fine. Good weight let’s stay one more for gradual increase
Adduction machine
* 175 (/2) x 10 x 3
* Notes: fine. Could also stay one more for gradual increase. Need stronger adductors
Squat
* 65 x 8 x 4
* Notes: up by 5, go go go. Shit, so I’ve been raising the right side elbow up too much, should bring wrist straight and pull elbow a bit to the front. Cuz wrist suffering. Really watch that right elbow, make sure it’s not too backwards, bring it forward similar to left side so we can engage the forearms to keep the wrist straight… mention this to David. I think keeping that good elbow position and pulling down on the bar is also important in engaging the forearms. Anyways, experiment with this with warmups before hitting the next weight.
